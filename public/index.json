They emerge from unexpected edge case sequences of state transitions that traditional tests never explore. Most of the smart contracts today rely heavily on unit tests. Unit tests validate correctness along expected flows. Attackers don’t follow expected flows. This is where fuzzing becomes indispensable.\nIn this article, we’ll walk through how to write real, invariant-driven fuzz tests using Trident, a purpose-built fuzzing framework for Solana programs.\n","title":"Fuzz solana programs like a Pro - Part 1"}]}
